### Abstract

AlemniscateofacomplexpolynomialQnofdegreenisasublevelsetofitsmodulus,i.e., of the form {z ∈ C : |Qn(z)| < t} for some t > 0. In general, the number of connected components of this lemniscate can vary anywhere between 1 and n. In this paper, we study the expected number of connected components for two models of random lemniscates. First, we show that lemniscates whose defining polynomial has i.i.d. roots chosen uniformly from D, has on average O(√n) number of connected components. On the other hand if the i.i.d. roots are chosen uniformly from S1, we show that the expected number of connected components, divided by n, converges to 21.
