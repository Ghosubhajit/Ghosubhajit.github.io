title: "ON THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS OF RANDOM POLYNOMIAL LEMNISCATES"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'A lemniscate of a complex polynomial Qn of degree n is a sublevel set of its modulus, i.e.,
of the form ${z ∈ C : |Qn(z)| < t}$ for some $t > 0$. In general, the number of connected components
of unit lemniscate (i.e. for t = 1) can vary anywhere between 1 and n. In this paper, we study the
expected number of connected components for two models of random lemniscates. First, we show
that lemniscates whose defining polynomial has i.i.d. roots chosen uniformly from D, has on average
$O(√n)$ number of connected components. On the other hand, if the i.i.d. roots are chosen uniformly
from S1, we show that the expected number of connected components, divided by n, converges to 1
