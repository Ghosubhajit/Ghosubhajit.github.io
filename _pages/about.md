I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [ISI Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in/), working under Prof. [D. Yogeshwaran](https://sites.google.com/site/yogeshwaranacademics/homehttps://sites.google.com/site/yogeshwaranacademics/home) and Prof. [Mathew Joseph](https://sites.google.com/view/mjoseph). My research is part of an externally funded SERB-CRG project titled "Poissonian Shot-Noise Fields and Diffusions." I am learning about the Brownian survival among traps coming from point processes. In addition, I am exploring techniques for obtaining bounds on Markov chain mixing times ([see here](https://sites.google.com/view/entropymc/)).  

Previously, I was an Integrated Ph.D. student at [TIFR-CAM](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in), working under the supervision of Prof. [Koushik Ramachandran](https://sites.google.com/site/koushikramachandran/home). My Ph.D. research focused on the metric and topological properties of [polynomial lemniscates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_lemniscate#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20polynomial%20lemniscate,complex%20coefficients%20of%20degree%20n.), both random and deterministic. In my work, I used tools from complex analysis, probability theory, and potential theory.
